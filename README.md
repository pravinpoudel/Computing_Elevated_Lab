# Computing_Elevated_Lab

 This is not an official repo of Lab but a temporary repo to store some of the learning and experimental side-works done by me under the roof of Computing Elevated Lab, USU under the guidance of Prof Dr Steve Petruzza. It does not anywhere represent the works going on in the Lab.
  
Any kind of edit, suggestion and upgrade is always welcome and not only this is to save my work but to encourage other to learn Computer Graphics.
  
Happy Learning Computer Graphics.
PS: Some of the interesting items related to this stuff can also be found in my blog:
