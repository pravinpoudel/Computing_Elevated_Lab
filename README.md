# Computing_Elevated_Lab

 This is not official repo of Lab but a temporary repo to store some of the learning and experimental side-work done under the roof of Computing Elevated Lab, USU under guidance of Prof Dr Steve Petruzza. It does not represent the works going on in Lab.
  
  Any kind of edit and upgrade is always welcome and not only this is to save our work but to encourage other to learn Computer Graphics.
  
  Happy Learning Computer Graphics.
